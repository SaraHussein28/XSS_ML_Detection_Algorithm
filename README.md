**XSSClassifier: Detection of XSS Attacks Using Machine Learning Approach**

**Research Paper:**
Based on this paper, machine learning classifiers are used for categorizing webpages into either XSS or non-XSS. The process primarily encompasses four steps: identifying features, gathering webpages, extracting features, and constructing a training dataset, and employing machine learning classification.

**Goal:**
Create a training algorithm for detecting an XSS attack vector in a Query Parameter string. 
Define a set of features that we can use to train the model and label a sample as XSS(1) or Not XSS(0).
